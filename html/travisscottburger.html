    <h3> Travis Scott is one of today's biggest and most popular artists. Not only does his music do insane numbers, but also his brand deals and partnerships. One of these was his McDonalds collab where he released a promotional meal with tones of marketing content. The meal included a customized Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Fries, BBQ Sauce, and a Sprite. Since we all know that McDonaldâ€™ is not the healthiest of foods, this burger recipe is an healthy, high in protien, and homemade version you can enjoy often. </h3>

<h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    
<ul>
    <li>80/20 Lean Ground Beef</li> 
    <li>Bacon of your choice </li>
    <li>American Cheese Slices </li>
    <li>Preped Veg: Shredded Letuce, Thinly Sliced White Onion, Sliced Pickles</li>
    <li>Sesame Seed Buns </li>
    <li>Condiments: Ketchup and Mustard </li>
</ul>
    
<h3>Steps:</h3> 
    
<ul>
    <ol type="1">
                <li>Split your beef into 4 equal parts. Roll each one into a ball and smash down until they are slightly larger than the size of your buns. (They will shrink!)</li>

                <li>In a nonstick pan, fry off the patties until they are cooked and golden brown.</li>

                <li>Before taking the patties off, top with a slick of cheese and cover with a lid for 20 seconds. Remove and put to the side.</li>

                <li>In the same pan, toast the buns until they are toasted to your liking.</li>

                <li>To assemble the burger, apply ketchup and mustard to the buns. Then add 2 of the patties on the bottom bun. Add the prepped veg and top off the burger. </li>    
    </ol>
</ul>
