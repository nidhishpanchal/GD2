    <h3>
      Rick Ross has a reputation for mentioning foods in his rap lyrics and
      making songs after food. Sometimes they have meaning, sometimes it is just
      for fun. What is evident though, is his love for food. Rick Ross’
      relationship with Lemon Pepper Wings first started when he was the
      promotional figure for Wingstop when they released this flavour. Flash
      forward to today, he now owns 25 Wingstop locations and was featured on
      Drake's Lemon Pepper Freestyle’ on Scary Hours 2. Here is a healthier air
      fried alternative recipe for this iconic flavour.
