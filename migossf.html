    <h3>
      The Migos are a rap group that exploded in the mid-2010s. Over the years
      they have done numerous collaborations and partnerships with many
      different companies. This recipe was sparked by Buzfeed’s Tasty after the
      Migos released a song called ‘Stirfry’. The song was a massive hit and
      caught the attention of the Buzzfeed producers. This led to Buzfeed
      reaching out to the Migo’s team for a collaboration video. The video had
      the 3 members chopping, stirring, and drizzling ingredients to their song.
      This video actually inspired me to make this website in the first place.
      Here’s the recipe:
    </h3>

    <br />

    <h3>Ingredients: Sauce</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ginger, grated</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>¼ cup creamy peanut butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ingredients: Stir Fry</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast, cubed</li>
      <li>½ red onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 cups broccoli floret</li>
      <li>¼ red cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups snap pea, sliced on the bias</li>
      <li>3 carrots, thinly peeled</li>

      <li>1 lb rice noodle, cooked</li>
      <li>¼ cup scallion, thinly sliced on the bias</li>
      <li>½ cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sesame seed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ul>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          In a bowl, add the soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, rice vinegar, peanut
          butter, garlic, and ginger, and whisk to combine.
        </li>

        <li>
          Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok or large pan over high heat. Once
          the oil begins to shimmer, add the cubed chicken and sprinkle with
          salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is
          cooked through, about 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>Transfer the chicken to the bowl, and wipe the wok clean.</li>

        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in the cleaned wok over high heat.</li>

        <li>
          Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the red onion, broccoli, and red
          cabbage, and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
          Add the red bell peppers and snap peas and cook for 3 minutes,
          stirring frequently, until the peppers begin to soften.
        </li>

        <li>Add the carrots and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>

        <li>
          Add the chicken, cooked rice noodles, and sauce, and stir until fully
          incorporated.
        </li>

        <li>Serve with cilantro, scallions, and sesame seeds</li>

        <li>Enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
